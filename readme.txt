== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this do? =

Adds a button to the TinyMCE to wrap an email address with a shortcode using the WordPress antispambot function. Obfuscates the email address so that only browsers can see the normal address, while the source code displays jumbled characters. Also includes a CSS class (a.email-link) if you want to style it differently that the rest of your site.
